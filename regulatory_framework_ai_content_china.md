## PART 2: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PORTRAIT RIGHTS (肖像权)

### 2.1 Civil Code Portrait Rights Framework

#### Article 1018 (Definition):
"自然人享有肖像权，有权依法制作、使用、公开或者许可他人使用自己的肖像。"
(A natural person enjoys the right to likeness, and is entitled to make, use, publicize, or authorize others to use his image in accordance with law.)

**Key implication:** Portrait rights include the right to AUTHORIZE others to use one's likeness -- this is the legal basis for a face-swapping content marketplace licensing model.

#### Article 1019 (Prohibited Conduct):
"任何组织或者个人不得以丑化、污损，或者利用信息技术手段伪造等方式侵害他人的肖像权。未经肖像权人同意，不得制作、使用、公开肖像权人的肖像，但是法律另有规定的除外。"

Translation: No organization or individual may infringe upon another person's portrait rights by uglifying, defacing, or **using information technology means to fabricate** in other ways. Without the consent of the portrait right holder, one shall not make, use, or publicly disclose the portrait of the portrait right holder, except as otherwise provided by law.

**Critical language:** "利用信息技术手段伪造" (using information technology means to fabricate) -- this directly covers AI face-swapping.

Additionally: Without consent of the portrait right holder, the copyright holder of the portrait work shall not use or publish the portrait in forms such as publication, reproduction, distribution, rental, or exhibition.

#### Article 1020 (Exceptions -- NO Commercial Exception):
Reasonable acts not requiring consent:
1. Personal study, artistic appreciation, classroom teaching, or scientific research (within necessary scope)
2. Unavoidable use for news reporting
3. State agencies within necessary scope for duties
4. Unavoidable use to display specific public environments
5. Other acts to maintain public interests or legitimate interests of the portrait right holder

**Note: There is NO commercial use exception.** All commercial use of another person's portrait requires explicit consent.

#### Article 1021 (Contract Interpretation Favoring Right Holder):
"当事人对肖像许可使用合同中关于肖像使用条款的理解有争议的，应当作出有利于肖像权人的解释。"
When parties dispute interpretation of portrait usage clauses in a portrait licensing contract, interpretation must favor the portrait right holder.

**Critical implication for marketplace contracts:** All licensing agreements for face-swapping must be drafted with absolute clarity because any ambiguity will be interpreted against the licensee (merchant) and in favor of the licensor (creator/portrait right holder).

#### Article 1023:
Authorized use of another person's name and similar rights shall apply the relevant provisions on authorized use of portraits mutatis mutandis.

### 2.2 How Portrait Rights Apply to AI-Generated Digital Humans

The Beijing Internet Court's 2024 ruling established a critical distinction:

**Portrait Rights vs. Personal Information Rights in Face-Swapping:**

- **Portrait rights infringement** requires that the generated content be "identifiable" to a specific individual. If the face-swap alters features to the point where the original person is not recognizable, portrait rights may NOT be infringed.
- **However**, the processing of facial data in creating face-swap templates constitutes processing of personal information, which triggers protections under PIPL even when the final output is not recognizable.

This creates a dual compliance requirement:
1. Even if the face-swap output does not look like the original person, the ACT of processing their facial data without consent infringes personal information rights
2. If the output IS recognizable, both portrait rights AND personal information rights are infringed

For digital humans created entirely from AI (not based on real persons), portrait rights generally do not apply because there is no natural person right holder. However, if the digital human is designed to resemble a specific real person, the portrait rights of that person attach.

### 2.3 Key Court Cases

#### Beijing Internet Court AI Face-Swapping Case (June 20, 2024)

**Court:** Beijing Internet Court (First Instance)
**Parties:** Short video models (plaintiffs) vs. AI face-swapping app operator (defendant)

**Facts:**
- Defendant used plaintiffs' videos to create face-swapping templates for commercial purposes
- Plaintiffs' facial information was processed to generate templates replicating their physical characteristics and movements
- Templates were offered as part of a paid service
- Defendant outsourced the actual face-swapping technology to a third-party company

**Key Holdings:**
1. **No portrait rights infringement** -- because the face-swapping process altered facial features such that the templates were not identifiable to the specific plaintiffs
2. **Personal information rights infringed** -- facial features in the original videos qualified as personal information under PIPL; the defendant's commercial processing without consent violated personal information protection rules
3. **Outsourcing does not relieve liability** -- even though the defendant used a third-party technology provider, as the entity that decided on the scope and manner of processing, the defendant bore liability
4. **Publicly available content still requires consent** -- plaintiffs' videos had explicit non-licensing marks; commercial use still required consent despite the content being publicly available

**Damages:** 2,500 yuan for economic losses; 1,000 yuan for mental anguish per plaintiff; public apology ordered

**Legal Significance for Content Marketplace:**
- Even if face-swap output is unrecognizable, using someone's facial data as source material requires consent
- Platform operators cannot escape liability by outsourcing AI processing
- Public availability of original content does not constitute consent for AI processing
- The damages were relatively modest, but the precedent is significant

#### Liu Haoran Defamation Case (AI Face-Swapping)
- A case involving unauthorized use of celebrity likeness through AI face-swapping technology
- Examined online infringement liability through the lens of defamation law
- Reinforced that AI-generated content using recognizable celebrity likenesses constitutes actionable infringement

#### Fuzhou AI Face-Swap Fraud Case (May 2023)
- Criminal case where AI face-swapping was used to impersonate a friend via video call
- Victim transferred 4.3 million yuan based on the convincing face-swap video
- Demonstrates criminal liability dimension of face-swapping technology misuse

### 2.4 Designing a Compliant Authorization Chain

Based on the legal framework, a compliant authorization chain for content trading with AI face replacement requires:

**Step 1: Portrait Right Holder Authorization**
- Written consent meeting Civil Code Article 1019 requirements
- Must specify: scope of use, duration, territory, types of modification permitted, sublicensing rights, compensation
- Any ambiguity interpreted in favor of the portrait right holder (Article 1021)
- Consent must be "separate consent" (单独同意) as required by PIPL for sensitive personal information

**Step 2: Content Copyright Licensing**
- Separate from portrait rights -- the video/image content itself has copyright
- Creator must license the underlying content for marketplace distribution
- Must address derivative works rights (the face-swapped version is a derivative)

**Step 3: Personal Information Processing Authorization**
- Under PIPL, facial data is sensitive personal information
- Requires: specified purpose, full necessity, heightened safeguards, and separate consent
- Must conduct personal information protection impact assessment before processing
- Data minimization and purpose limitation principles apply

**Step 4: Platform Distribution Rights**
- Platform must have rights to host, display, and distribute the content
- Must have rights to add required labeling and watermarks
- Must have audit and takedown rights

| Penalties | Administrative (warnings, service suspension) | Up to 7% global revenue |
| Consent for face-swapping | Required (separate consent) | Transparency disclosure required |

### 5.2 United States (State Laws)

The US has no comprehensive federal AI regulation. Instead, a patchwork of state laws addresses deepfakes:

#### California (Most Active -- 24 AI-related laws in 2024-2025):
- **AB 2655 (Defending Democracy From Deepfake Deception Act):** Imposed removal obligations on large platforms during 120 days before elections. However, struck down by a federal judge on August 5 on First Amendment grounds.
- **AB 2355 (Effective January 1, 2025):** Requires political advertisements using AI-generated or substantially altered content to include disclosure.
- **SB 942 (California AI Transparency Act):** Mandates AI systems with 1M+ monthly visitors in California implement comprehensive disclosure measures. Penalties: $5,000 per violation per day.

#### Texas:
- Among the first states (with California and Virginia) to enact deepfake laws in 2019
- Prohibits publication of political deepfakes during specified period before elections
- Has enacted 8 new AI-related laws in 2025

#### Broader US Landscape:
- 28 states have enacted laws addressing deepfakes in political communications
- 46 states have enacted laws concerning deepfakes depicting explicit sexual content
- Most states opt for disclosure requirements due to First Amendment concerns
- No federal standard for commercial AI face-swapping disclosure

### 5.3 Global Platform Policies

- Personal information protection impact assessment (PIIA) for facial data processing
- Security assessment if data crosses borders
- Filing with provincial internet information department when facial data reaches 100,000 persons

#### Layer 2: Technical Measures

**A. Watermarking System:**
- **Implicit watermarks:** Embed invisible watermarks in all AI-generated content using techniques similar to Google's SynthID -- pixel-level changes resilient to compression, resizing, and screenshotting
- **Metadata labeling:** Embed structured metadata per Article 5 of the Labeling Measures containing: content attribute (AI-generated), provider name/code, content reference number, creation timestamp, consent chain reference IDs
- **C2PA compliance:** Adopt C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) standards for interoperability with global platforms; enables cryptographic signing and digital fingerprinting

**B. Explicit Labeling System:**
- **Video content:** AI-generated label at video start, in display area (covering at least 1/10 of screen per Douyin requirements), and at end
- **Image content:** Conspicuous label in consistent position
- **Audio content:** Voice or audio cue at beginning
- **Label format:** Standardized text such as "AI生成" (AI-generated) or "AI换脸" (AI face-swapped)

**C. Consent Management System:**
- Digital consent collection with blockchain or tamper-evident audit trail
- Separate consent forms for: portrait rights licensing, personal information processing, biometric data processing
- Consent status tracking per individual per use case
- Automated consent expiry alerts
- Consent withdrawal processing pipeline

**D. Content Provenance Tracking:**
- Unique content ID for every piece of content entering the marketplace
- Full provenance chain: original content -> consent records -> face-swap processing -> output content -> distribution records
- Immutable audit log (blockchain or append-only database)
- Ability to trace any distributed content back to original consent chain

**E. AI Detection and Verification:**
- Automated detection of AI-generated content that lacks proper labeling
- Facial recognition matching to verify consent chain (i.e., confirm the face in the output matches the consented individual)
- Quality assurance checks on face-swap outputs to ensure they do not create defamatory or misleading content

#### Layer 3: Operational Processes

**A. Content Review Process:**
1. **Pre-listing review:** Before any content template enters the marketplace:
   - Verify all consent documentation is complete and valid
   - Verify content does not violate prohibited content categories
   - Verify labeling compliance (both explicit and implicit)
   - Check for potential defamation, obscenity, or political sensitivity
2. **Post-listing monitoring:**
   - Continuous monitoring for complaints and reports
   - Periodic sampling review of marketplace content
   - Automated scanning for consent expiry
3. **Merchant output review:**
   - Review of face-swapped output content before distribution
   - Verify face-swap did not create misleading or harmful content
   - Verify advertising compliance for commercial use cases

**B. Appeal and Dispute Resolution:**
1. **Creator appeals:** Process for creators to challenge removal or licensing disputes
2. **Merchant appeals:** Process for merchants to challenge content restrictions
3. **Third-party complaints:** Process for individuals claiming unauthorized use of their likeness
4. **Response timeline:** 24-hour acknowledgment, 72-hour initial review, 15-day resolution target
5. **Escalation:** To legal team for complex cases, to regulators if required by law

**C. Takedown Process:**
1. **Automated takedown triggers:**
   - Consent withdrawal by portrait right holder
   - Detection of prohibited content
   - Regulatory order
   - Court order
2. **Manual takedown:**
   - Complaint-driven review and takedown
   - Platform-initiated takedown for compliance concerns
3. **Downstream notification:**
   - Notify all merchants who have purchased/used the affected content
   - Require merchants to remove downstream uses within specified timeline
4. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain records of all takedown actions for regulatory compliance
   - Minimum retention: 3 years for personal information-related records

**D. Training and Awareness:**
- Regular compliance training for all platform staff
- Creator onboarding that includes regulatory education
- Merchant compliance guides
- Updated training upon regulatory changes

#### Layer 4: Insurance and Liability Allocation

**A. Platform Liability:**
- Platform bears responsibility for:
  - Content moderation system adequacy
  - Labeling system implementation and maintenance
  - Consent chain verification infrastructure
  - Compliance with platform-specific regulations
  - Reporting obligations to regulators
- Recommended: Cyber liability insurance covering:
  - Data breach costs (facial data breach)
  - Regulatory fines and penalties
  - Third-party claims for IP/portrait rights infringement
  - Legal defense costs

**B. Creator Liability:**
- Creator bears responsibility for:
  - Truthfulness of their representations about content ownership
  - Validity of their right to license their likeness
  - Accuracy of their declarations about third-party rights in content
- Creator agreement should include:
  - Indemnification clause for IP infringement claims
  - Representations and warranties about rights ownership
  - Obligation to maintain relevant consents from any third parties appearing in content

**C. Merchant Liability:**
- Merchant bears responsibility for:
  - Proper use of licensed content within authorized scope
  - Compliance with labeling requirements on face-swapped output
  - Advertising compliance for commercial use
  - Not exceeding licensed use cases
- Merchant agreement should include:
  - Usage restrictions and prohibited use cases
  - Indemnification for misuse of content
  - Obligation to maintain labeling on distributed content
  - Obligation to comply with takedown requests

**D. Tri-Party Insurance Framework:**
- **Platform insurance:** Comprehensive cyber and E&O (errors and omissions) insurance
- **Creator protection fund:** Platform-managed fund for creator disputes (funded by marketplace fees)
- **Merchant deposit:** Refundable security deposit against compliance violations
- **Mutual indemnification:** Clear indemnification chain in all agreements

**E. Liability Cap Structure:**
- Platform liability capped at: platform fees collected for the specific transaction (industry standard per research findings)
- Creator liability capped at: license fees received for the specific content
- Merchant liability: Uncapped for willful misuse; capped at transaction value for good-faith errors
- Note: Regulatory penalties cannot be capped or indemnified -- each party bears its own regulatory exposure
